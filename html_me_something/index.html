            <p>
                I've been a fan of All Time Low for longer than I realized initially.
                Early in their career I had heard their singles on the radio and enjoyed them,
                but never really followed them.  Then shortly after I got out of college I started
                to really enjoy their music and have since seen them twice at the Pageant and will
                again in July with one of my best friends.  They always put on such an upbeat and
                uplifting performance that I'm excited to introduce my friend to them.

            <p>
                I've been a fan of Fall Out Boy since their beginnings in 2003.  I was just starting
                high school and their early angsty lyrics combined with twists on common phrases drew
                me in and I've been a fan ever since.  One of my favorite things about this band is that
                no two albums they put out sound the same.  They have been constantly evolving and experimenting
                with their sound, so it's not the same sound rehashed over and over again, but they still occasionally
                keep some of the things I grew to love in place.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have seen Fall Out Boy perform many times over the years with my favorite cousin and
                fellow concert buddy.  We can both say that we were lucky enough to see one of the very
                last performances they made back in 2009 before they went on a 4 year hiatus and one of the sold out
                early performances they made at the Pageant upon their return in 2013.  It was after the 2013 comeback
                show that my cousin and I actually got to briefly meet the lead singer after the show.

            <p>
                I became a fan of My Chemical Romance late in the game, but they are still one of my favorite
                bands.  I hope to one day actually get the chance to see them perform live, but that is unlikely
                to be anytime in the near future.  They share many similar characteristics to Fall Out Boy in that
                no two albums they have sound the same.  I also really enjoy how their albums generally have a
                cohesive theme that tells a story.

                I have many fond memories involving Nightwish concerts.  Seeing Nightwish at Pop's was the first
                concert my now husband and I went to as a date.  This show was with their second lead female vocalist
                and was a good show.  However, the most memorable experience I have is that a few days after the show
                at Pop's the lead female vocalist quit and they brought in another amazing female vocalist as a "temporary"
                member to fill in for the rest of the US tour.  When we received news of this, we quickly discovered that
                the last show they were doing in the states was at Orlando's House of Blues at Disney World.  My cousin
                was a Disney intern at the time and we spontaneously decided to take a vacation to Disney World to see
                the new singer.  The entire trip was put together on about a week's notice and involved lots of scheduling
                conflicts since we had to fly down separately, but it was an experience I will never forget.
